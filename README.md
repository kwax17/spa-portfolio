## Description

This is a website/resume built through React.  The user first sees the about me section, but can easily access the other sections through the navigation bar on the side.  There are links to linkedin, github, and youtube, as well as the individual projects.  The user can also download the resume file, as well as send and email.

## Installation

To install the react app, cd into the directory you would like to store the folder.  Enter 'npx create-react-app photo-port' and the files with download.  If you have an existing react app, just replace the src folder to see the data.  

## Commands

To see the project in development mode, enter 'npm start' amd navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. It will reload with every saved change.

To build the project into a single folder/production mode, enter 'npm run build.'  This bundles everything together and optimizes performance so the files can be deployed.
