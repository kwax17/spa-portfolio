                <p>Hey I'm Kelly. I'm a web designer, graphic designer, filmmaker, and photographer. I currently live at the Jersey Shore and work at a local newspaper, but I love to explore the world in my free time. When I'm not on my computer, I enjoy being outdoors whether surfing, skating, or just reading a book.</p>
